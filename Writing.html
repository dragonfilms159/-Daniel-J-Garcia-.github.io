    Below is the script for my in-progress game "Mark and Melissa". It's a short horror experience whose ending will change based on character choice.
    Mark is a 28-year-old man taking his 10-year-old daughter Melissa home from school. After a tutorial where players are tasked with making dinner for the pair,
    players are warned that they should get Melissa to bed soon, but they have the option to do various tasks around the house first. The more tasks players do,
    the more eerie events will happen, hinting to them that something is off with Melissa. After the player completes their desired number of tasks,
    they put Melissa to bed, and one of three endings plays out. In the spirit of player freedom, I decided to allow players to complete the optional tasks
    in any order, and this is reflected in the script, where notes dictate which scenes play out based on which tasks players complete.

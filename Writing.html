    Below is the script for my in-progress game "Mark and Melissa". It's a short horror experience whose ending will change based on character choice.
    Mark is a 28-year-old man taking his 11-year-old daughter Melissa home from school. After a tutorial where players are tasked with making dinner for the pair,
    players are warned that they should get Melissa to bed soon, but they have the option to do various tasks around the house first. The more tasks players do,
    the more eerie events will happen, hinting to them that something is off with Melissa. After the player completes their desired number of tasks,
    they put Melissa to bed, and one of three endings plays out. In the spirit of player freedom, I decided to allow players to complete the optional tasks
    in any order, and this is reflected in the script, where notes dictate which scenes play out based on which tasks players complete.

    This is a short music video that I directed and edited, with music written, performed, mixed, and mastered by me.
    The instrumental and additional vocals were provided by the artist D. Cure. This video was created as part of a music
    challenge hosted by D. Cure, where you had to create lyrics and a video based only on the phrase "How'd I Get Here?"
    I wrote the lyrics and crafted the scenes to fit a narrative about waking up trapped in a mysterious place, only
    to discover a clone of myself was my captor. This is to illustrate my ability to write a variety of different lines
    even with minimal direction and with limitations in place.

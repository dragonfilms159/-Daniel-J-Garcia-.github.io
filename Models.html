        The following models were created entirely by hand in Maya, with texturing and animation done by me where applicable.

    <p>This is a simple 3D model of the character Garnet from the animated series "Steven Universe".
      The model was created from scratch by me, and has been fully rigged and skinned.</p>

        This video shows a quick preview of an edit I did for a music video of mine.
        It includes motion tracking (both automatic and by manual keyframing), color correction/grading, and a few other effects.

        This is a short music video that I directed and edited, with music written, performed, mixed, and mastered by me.
        The instrumental and additional vocals were provided by the artist D. Cure.

    <p>The following photos are all from albums I've released under the stage name "Danny Dragon". They were created in Gimp,
        with all visual design done by me.

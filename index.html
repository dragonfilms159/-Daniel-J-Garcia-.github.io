    My name is Daniel Joseph Garcia, and I was born in Apple Valley, California on May 27th, 2000. I grew up playing video games and have been in
    love with them my whole life. I recently graduated from The University of California, Irvine, earning my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Game Science.
    I've aspired to create meaningful experiences for my audience ever since I got to college, and I strive to someday make an important, positive impact on the world.
    I've already helped make music, models, animations, and more for a few titles throughout my college career, and I hope to continue creating well into the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm skilled in programming languages such as: C++, C#, and Python, and am currently learning HTML/CSS and JavaScript
    (everything on this web portfolio was coded/designed by yours truly). I'm also proficient in my use of  the following programs:
    Photoshop, Gimp, Maya, Unity, Unreal, Lightworks, Hitfilm, Audacity, & Cubase.

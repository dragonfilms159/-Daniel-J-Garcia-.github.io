    My name is Daniel Joseph Garcia, and I was born in Apple Valley, California on May 27th, 2000. I grew up playing video games and have been in
    love with them my whole life. I am currently attending The University of California, Irvine to earn my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Game Science.
    I've aspired to create meaningful experiences for players ever since I got to college, and I strive to someday make an important impact on the industry.
    I'm hard-working and extremely passionate, and I put my all into every project I am a part of. I've already helped make music, models,
    animations, and more for a few small titles throughout my college career, and I hope to continue creating well into the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm familiar with programming languages such as: C++, C#, and Python, and am currently learning HTML and JavaScript
    (everything on this web portfolio was coded/designed by yours truly). I'm also proficient in my use of  the following programs:
    Photoshop, Gimp, Maya, Unity, Lightworks, Hitfilm, Audacity, & Cubase.
  </p>

    The tabs at the top of this website will lead you to different areas of my work, including music, models and animation, and video edits I've made.
    I'll be regularly adding to this portfolio as I create more content, and if you have any questions or inquiries, my email is:

      <strong>All of the following songs were written, produced, mixed, and mastered by me. They each were created in Cubase, with some sound editing done in Audacity.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
      This is an eerie song I created for the game "Play Time". It uses simple instrumentation to set a tense vibe while maintaining the whimsical nature
      of the setting and characters of the title.

      These two tracks both set an intense, frightening tone for important story segments of the visual novel "Beyond The Reflection".
      They use simple, yet noticeable instruments to create a mood without robbing players of their focus on the story.

  <p>This song is an instrumental I made for my hip-hop song "Aye, Yuh!" It uses a heavy kick, simple guitar melody, and an intense
    synth to create an epic and bombastic sound.

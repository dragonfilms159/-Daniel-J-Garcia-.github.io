    <!--show Petz content with video of me explaining my involvement,images and explanation of my design on A.I.M., and other design choices made by me.-->

        <strong>This page showcases my design experience on projects from college as well as my solo game project "Mark and Melissa"</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Linked here is a video that showcases the student game "Petz", and explains the programming and design I contributed to the project.

    </p>

    <p> The following is an advertisement video I created for the virtual reality project "A.I.M.", created as part of a software design course.
        I was Project Manager for the project, scheduling team meetings, assigning tasks to teammates, presenting progress to the class at designated meetings,
        and documenting development over the course of the class. This advertisement summarizes the projects goals and the outcomes of our design decisions, since
        the project didn't go as far as actual VR prototyping.
    </p>

    <!-- Here is a video explaining my involvement as Project Manager of "A.I.M.", from my fabrication of the software idea to the layout of the prototype.</p>
    video should explain what I did, how it was my idea (from a set of choices), show design documentation and script written, explain mission statement,
    explain design choices as well as the re-design process where applicable, and lead into the advertisement video.-->
  
    <p>
        Below is the full game design document for "Mark and Melissa", with sections for Gameplay, UI, and Coding. I also left in my "Random Idea"
        and "Things to Consider" sections, to illustrate that often times, in the middle of design, an idea will arise that I don't want to forget.
        These won't necessarily make it into the game, but are good to keep in mind in order to make the player experience smoother and/or
        to make my future work easier by reminding me of rules to follow or design principles to prioritize.
